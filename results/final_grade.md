### Report Grade (43.75/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

Technical Approach: effective combination of algorithms to overcome limitations
Motivation for Technical Approach: thorough analysis of game behavior, convincing choice of approach
Pros/cons of Chosen Approach: thorough engagement with theory/experiment, well demonstrated. Some statements are made a vague by lack of detail (e.g. opponent AI more efficient" "builds advantage" how?)"
Future Improvements: some good ideas but could use a bit more detail, elaboration
Language and Writing: Well explained, though some problems with concision (for instance, theoretical basis" section has a bit too much general detail about approaches and not enough specific description of how its relevant to the game itself)"
Organization: nothing to nitpick, great intro/conclusion/use of figures
